    <h1>Daniel Slinky's MySpace page</h1>
    <p><strong>This is my website</strong> There are billions like it, but this one is MySpace. It's probably the most
      professional social media precence I have.</p>

    <p>
    <blockquote>In every job that must be done, there is an element of fun. You find the fun and... snap! The job's a
      game. And every task you undertake, becomes a piece of cake. A lark! A spree! It's very clear to see That... a...
      Spoonful of Sugar helps the medicine go down, the medicine go do--own, the medicine go down.<cite>Miss. Poppins,
        circa 1986.</cite></blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>My name is Slinky, and sometimes I'm Eeyore and I get snapped by Thanos. I run legacy hardware, with an expired
      warranty but I can be upgraded for future workloads as required. My daily driver is an iPad Pro, which I enjoy and
      I run Fedora natively on my 2020 13" Macbook Pro.</p>
    <h2>Resume</h2>
    <p>I'm currently looking for a <em>REMOTE</em> job, or a ~hybrid role. I'm open to re-location discussions if you
      can provide assistance, and you have a good canteen. I'm based in Devon, United Kingdom. I maintain a professional
      home office environment; unlike my social media.</p>

    <p>I have <em>lots</em> of experience as a "Linux Systems Administrator". I don't know what I want to do next, so
      feel free to make a suggestion on <a href="https://linkedin.com/danslinky" target="_blank">my LinkedIn</a>.
    <div class="resume">
      <ul>
        <li>Age 16, I was in ALPHA as the IT kid for an audio/visual and home cinema installation business in my village
          in Cornwall. I was banned from using Super Glue for life in this role.</a>
        <li>Age 18, I was BETA testing as Junior Linux SysAdmin for amplifeyesolutions.com, a small Cornish web design
          and hosting business. In this role I learn't how painful the `chmod` command can be if incorrectly used. An
          experienced Linux Systems Administrator reading this might recognise this situation, and can be reassure I
          have read `man` since then. Sorry, Dan.</li>
        <li>Unleashed in to PRODUCTION in 2007, I developed Linux installation software at CERN using Perl, RPC/XML and
          Oracle after being invited as a Technical Student. The software I poorly developed is still in production in
          2024 :/ Because the Internet never forgets, I can share some links I have found: <a
            href="https://linux.web.cern.ch/installation/aims/">RTFM</a>, <a
            href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LinuxSupport/Aims2">what's Dan doing?</a>, and a <a
            href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/LinuxSupport/Aims2/aims2.ppt">PowerPoint</a> presentation to the IT
          department. One day I hope to be able to publish a statement of affairs regarding my software being used at
          the LHC. Some of my friends have made much bigger contributions that me though.</li>
        <li>In 2009, I look out a £18,000 loan for a degree in <a
            href="https://info.uwe.ac.uk/programmes/specification.asp?file=g710-1040.pdf" target="_blank">Information
            Systems Analysis</a> and <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/depression/"
            target="_blank">Depression</a>. After graduating, my first role was supporting Drupal 5 LAMP+ stacks for
          charities and NGOs. I was able to use my experience in my last role as we started to operate a Cloud platform
          for the first time using XEN and VMWare ESXi/vSphere. I'm proud to have worked with people who want to help
          others and I enjoyed working on their technical challenges. This was the start of my learning about Docker,
          thanks to my exposure to OpenVZ. Thanks to this and other roles, I've been able to complete paying back my
          student loan.</li>
        <li>2012, I launched a Drupal 6 website for Eurostar which hit its revenue target on day 1. As a team we
          developed and launched a Drupal + ActiveMQ platform to support eurostar.com ecommerce operations. My focus was
          on DevOps engineering from project iniation through to production and involved technical and technical project
          management with third parties including Rackspace. I also provided offshore training to Capgemini India to
          ensure we were able to support the customer and their business, and other customers including Royal Mail and
          Burberry.</li>
        <li>Also in 2012, I watched a lot of sport and the Government said I could use a lot of walkie talkies in
          London.</li>
        <li>In 2013, I embraced Xen, Juniper, Nginx and string rack cabling displine for a Future PLC. I started as an
          Operations Engineer in a small WebOps team, supporting a broad web and digital media estate. This include a
          multiple physical data center relocations. Over time I progress in to a slight leadership role of a larger
          operations engineering team </li>
        <li>In 2015, I was a Linux SysAdmin for charities and NGOs, and discovered Kubernetes and Ubiquiti</li>
        <li>In 2016, I cried and went for a bike ride in France. I have a 2012 Cannondale Carbon Synapse, with f' SRAM
          :/</li>
        <li>In 2017, I joined Adarga by offering my Kubernetes DevOps experience to start the foundations of a AI SaaS
          platform. I'm proud of my contributions iniating a long term </li>
        <li>In 2018, I did some <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43823532">Cyber Security Incident
            training for Taskrabbit</a>, resulting in root. Everywhere. They did not ask for it, nor did they like it.
          They have decided they do not want to talk about it. They made it very easy, and initially I did just tell all
          about it, but as I said, they don't want to talk about it. I was a bit miffed about that, and gave them a slap
          in the face for their troubles. I have apologised, and will continue to do so.</li>
        <li>In 2019, I contracted with Adarga focussing on CI/CD</li>
        <li>In 2020, I stayed indoors and did not talk about The Event. I also did some Machine Learning Infrastructure
          Engineering with Kubernetes for Cookpad in Bristol. I had a focus on Kubernetes deployment and observability
          using a range of Cloud Native products including FluxCD, Prometheus and Elastic. We also took time to explore
          a range of MLops possibilities including Kubeflow. I also decided to buy a new house.</li>
        <li>In 2021, I moved into the Site Reliability Engineering team at Cookpad. A highlight of this role was
          learning-to-learn Go. </li>
        <li>In 2022, I joined Adarga again, as a Lead Platform Engineer focussed on AWS cost reduction, Single Sign On
          (OpenID/SAML), being TOC for partners and customers including the Ministry of Defence, AWS, Microsoft and
          Auth0 amongst others.

          , partnerships and platform development and operation. Adarga terminated my employment in 2023.</li>
        <li>In 2024, I updated my website for the first time in a while and registered for Universal Credit. I still
          need to fix the DNS. Perahps I can show you on a video call how I will fix the DNS? In the mean time I can
          show you what this website looked like in <a

      <h2>Kids and Drugs</h2>
      <p>I don't have kids but if I did, I would tell them <q><b>don't do drugs, kids</b></q>.</p>
      <p>I do <b>do drugs, kids</b>, I unfortuantly have to do drugs for my axiety and depression, my eating disorder
        and sometimes I just feel like an imposter in my job. My NHS number is available on request.</p>
      <p>I do like going to Glastonbury with my friend Frank. I live next to Dartmoor. I like the Tour de France. I like
        to have fun.</p>

      <h2>My Music Collection</h2>
      <p>My music collection is known to drift through my microphone in to a colleagues ears at the start of a standup
        or an incident @huddle. Here's a little introduction to my music collection. I do take requests!</p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>
        And now, the end is near. And so I face, the final curtain. My friend, I'll say it clear. I'll state my case, of
        which I'm certain. I've lived, a life that's full. I travelled each and every highway. And more, much more than
        this. He did it his way. Regrets, I've had a few. But then again, too few to mention. I did, what I had to do.
        And saw it through, without exemption. I planned, each chartered course. Each careful step, along the by-way And
        more, much more than this. He did it his way. Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew. When I bit off, more
        than I could chew. But through it all, when there was doubt. I ate it up, and spit it out I faced it all, and I
        stood tall. And he did it his way I've loved, I've laughed, and cried. I've had my fill, my share of losing. And
        now, as tears subside. He finds it all, so amusing. To think, I did all that. And may I say, not in a shy way.
        Oh no, oh no, not me He did it his way. For what is a man, what has he got? If not himself, then he has null. To
        say the things he truly feels. And not the words of one who kneels. The record shows, I took the blows.
        <br />
        And did it my way.
        <br />
        Yes, it was MY way.
