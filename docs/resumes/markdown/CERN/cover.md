# Dear CERN

I am writing to express my interest in the DevOps Technical Engineer role within the Platforms and Workflows group. With extensive experience spanning SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, and co-location, I am excited to contribute my skills to your team.

My career highlights include pivotal moments in Container, Orchestration, and Cloud Native technologies. I am an avid supporter of open source, actively contributing and embracing the community's collaborative spirit.

In terms of the specific competencies sought for this position:

- **DevSecOps Expertise**: As a senior technical DevSecOps professional, I have led operations and optimizations for mission-critical containerized and virtual multi-vendor cloud services. My expertise encompasses supporting design, deployment, and orchestration with GitOps and CI/CD workflows, catering to diverse stakeholder needs and technical requirements.

- **Programming Languages**: Confident in Golang and Python, I continuously expand my toolkit. Although my Perl experience dates back to my tenure at CERN, I have recently added a small amount of Lua to my repertoire and am intrigued by Rust's potential, encouraged by Linus's endorsement and the language's innovative features.

- **CNCF Projects and IaC Tools**: My technical proficiency extends to CNCF projects like Kustomize, Flux, and Argo, alongside IaC solutions including Terragrunt, Terraform, and Ansible. I am well-versed in Cloud Native as a service, particularly GitHub, GitLab and Cloudflare.

- **System Administration**: My experience encompasses administering both public and private systems, managing releases, applying patches (and the inevitable follow-up patches), executing cloud and email migrations, and performing critical data restorations.

I pride myself on providing unparalleled support, swiftly identifying, assessing, mitigating, and resolving issues with a pragmatic approach. My incident response skills are a point of pride, as reflected in my LinkedIn testimonials.

I am committed to delivering solutions that not only meet but exceed expectations. I thrive in collaborative environments, sharing a passion for the tools we use and the experiences we share.

Fluent in English (both ASCII and unicode), and equipped with an Elgato Wave microphone and an iPad, I eagerly anticipate contributing to the CERN Community. I am also keen on enhancing documentation, particularly in markdown, and sharing knowledge, whether through casual coffee chats or more formal settings like FOSDEM. In fact, I aim to present a lightning talk in French at FOSDEM, potentially on markdown.

Thank you for considering my application. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring my technical expertise, collaborative spirit, and passion for open-source to the Platforms and Workflows team at CERN. I am also deeply inspired by CERN's commitment to diversity as a foundational value and its role in the organization's success.

Best regards,

Dan Slinky
