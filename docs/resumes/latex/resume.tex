\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

As an experienced engineer with specializations in Platform, Site
Reliability, and DevSecOps, I have played a pivotal role in designing,
developing, and maintaining various projects. My expertise in container
orchestration has enabled me to optimize platform performance, ensuring
robust security and seamless integration of machine learning models and
services.

I am a collaborative team player and have effectively collaborated with
diverse teams, including engineers, product managers, and stakeholders,
to overcome technical challenges and enhance organizational processes.
My priority is always to ensure that solutions are not only functional
but also easily maintainable, scalable, and observable. I am also
passionate about creating a culture of continuous learning and knowledge
sharing to drive innovation and promote team growth.

of Recommendation} and
\href{https://linkedin.com/in/danslinky}{Endorsements} for Dan Slinky
can be submitted using GitHub or LinkedIn.

\begin{quote}
Dan is one of the best platform engineers I've worked with. He has a
vast knowledge of AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform and similar platform
technologies. I learned a lot while working together. He is capable of
taking a vague requirement and converting it into working
infrastructure. He puts thought into the maintainability, scalability
and observability of his solutions and writes good accompanying
documentation. Dan is also a good mentor helping other in the team and
even outside of his team upskill and learn from him.

-- Robert Marsal, Enterprise Architect at Adarga
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Dan is one of the most technical platform engineers I've worked with. I
would watch in awe as he calmly debugged and resolved production
incidents. Day to day he is a thoughtful colleague whose advice I would
trust on the design and implementation of cloud native infrastructure
and the general practice of platform engineering.

-- Mark deVilliers, Engineering Leader
