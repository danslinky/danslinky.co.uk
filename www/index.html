        I run legacy hardware, with an expired warranty but I can be upgraded

        I'm currently looking for a <mark><em>REMOTE</em></mark> or ~hybrid role. I'm open to re-location discussions if you
        can assist, and you have a good canteen and mountain views.

          At age 16, I was in ALPHA as the IT kid for an

            >audio-visual and home cinema installation business</a

          Age 18, I was BETA testing as a Junior Linux SysAdmin for
          <a href="https://whois.domaintools.com/amplifeyesolutions.com"
            >Amplifeye Solutions</a
          >, a small Cornish web design and hosting business. I had a focus on

            >OSCommerce</a
          >. In this role, I learned how painful the `chmod` command can be if
          incorrectly used. An experienced Linux Systems Administrator reading
          this might recognize this situation and can be reassured I have read
          `man` since then. Sorry,

          Unleashed into PRODUCTION in 2007, I developed
          <mark>Linux</mark> installation software at
          <mark id="cern">CERN</mark> using <mark>Perl</mark>,
          <mark>RPC/XML</mark> and <mark>Oracle</mark> after being invited as a

          In 2009, I took out an £18,000 loan for a degree in
          <a

          <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/depression/"
            >Depression</a
          >. After graduating, my first role was supporting
          <mark>Drupal 5 LAMP+</mark> stacks for charities and NGO. I was able
          to use my experience in my last role as we started to operate a Cloud
          platform for the first time using <mark>Xen</mark> and
          <mark>VMWare</mark> ESXi/vSphere. I'm proud to have worked with people
          who want to help others and I enjoyed working on their technical
          challenges. This was the start of my learning about Docker, thanks to
          my exposure to <mark>OpenVZ</mark>. Thanks to this and other roles,
          I've been able to complete paying back my student loan.
        </li>

        <li>
          2012, I launched a <mark>Drupal 6</mark> website for
          <mark id="eurostar">Eurostar</mark> which hit its revenue target on
          day 1. As an agile team, we developed and launched a Drupal +
          <mark>ActiveMQ</mark> platform to support Eurostar's e-commerce
          operations. My focus was on DevOps engineering from project initiation
          through to production and involved technical and technical project
          management with third parties including Rackspace. I also provided
          offshore training to Capgemini India to ensure we were able to support
          the customer and their business, and other customers including Royal
          Mail and Burberry.
        </li>
        <li>
          Also in 2012, I volunteered at the
          <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-19201329">Olympics</a> and the
          Government said I could use a lot of walkie-talkies in central London.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 2013, I embraced Xen, <mark>Juniper</mark>, <mark>Nginx</mark>, and
          string rack cabling discipline for <mark id="future">Future</mark>. I
          started as an Operations Engineer in a small WebOps team, supporting a
          broad web and digital media estate. This included multiple physical
          data center relocations to support consolidation, supporting CDN and Ad delivery platforms and
          providing mentorship to colleagues. Over time I progress into a
          slight leadership role of a larger operations engineering team
        </li>

        <li>
          In 2015, I was a Linux SysAdmin for charities and NGOs, and discovered
          Kubernetes and Ubiquiti for
          <mark id="torchbox">Torchbox</mark>. This role had a focus on
          <a href="https://wagtail.org/"><mark>Wagtail</mark></a> and Drupal
          platform support. This role taught me that organising a company office
          move is hard work and requires strong planning and collaboration. Some
          <a href="https://crt.sh/?id=12445333">Internet archaeology</a> also
          shows me working with <mark>Riemann</mark>, <mark>Sensu</mark>,

          Synapse, with f' SRAM :/

        <li>
          In 2017, I joined <mark id="adarga">Adarga</mark> by offering my

          a AI SaaS platform.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 2018, I did some
          <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43823532"
            >Cyber Security Incident training for Taskrabbit</a
          >, resulting in <code>root</code>. Everywhere. They did not ask for it, nor did
          they like it. They have decided they do not want to talk about it.
          They made it very easy, and initially I did just tell all about it,
          but as I said, they don't want to talk about it. I was a bit miffed
          about that, and gave them a slap in the face for their troubles. I
          have apologised, and will continue to do so.

          This was an enjoyable and unique opportunity to review the platform so

          In 2020, I stayed indoors and did not talk about The Event. I also did
          some Machine Learning Infrastructure Engineering with Kubernetes for
          <a href="https://cookpad.com/us">Cookpad</a> in Bristol. I had a focus
          on Kubernetes deployment and observability using a range of

          <a href="https://kustomize.io/"><mark>Kustomize</mark></a

        <li>
          In 2021, I moved into the Site Reliability Engineering team at

          In 2022, I joined <mark id="adarga">Adarga</mark> again, as a Lead

      <h2>My Music Collection</h2>
      <p>
        My
        <a href="https://rtfm.danslinky.co.uk/choons">music collection</a> is
        known to drift through my microphone in to a colleagues ears at the
        start of a standup or an incident @huddle. Here's a little introduction
        to my music collection. I do take requests!
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        And now, the end is near. And so I face, the final curtain. My friend,
        I'll say it clear. I'll state my case, of which I'm certain. I've lived,
        a life that's full. I travelled each and every highway. And more, much
        more than this. He did it his way. Regrets, I've had a few. But then
        again, too few to mention. I did, what I had to do. And saw it through,
        without exemption. I planned, each chartered course. Each careful step,
        along the by-way And more, much more than this. He did it his way. Yes,
        there were times, I'm sure you knew. When I bit off, more than I could
        chew. But through it all, when there was doubt. I ate it up, and spit it
        out I faced it all, and I stood tall. And he did it his way I've loved,
        I've laughed, and cried. I've had my fill, my share of losing. And now,
        as tears subside. He finds it all, so amusing. To think, I did all that.
        And may I say, not in a shy way. Oh no, oh no, not me He did it his way.
        For what is a man, what has he got? If not himself, then he has null. To
        say the things he truly feels. And not the words of one who kneels. The
        record shows, I took the blows.
        <br />
        And did it my way.
        <br />
        Yes, it was MY way.

        I,
        <em
          ><b><u>DO NOT RECOMMEND</u></b></em
        >
        buying a house from Redrow. It has not been a pleasant experience, and
        my new front door is still wonky. I am more than a little miffed, and so
        are my neighbours, because we have told them this more than a few times.
