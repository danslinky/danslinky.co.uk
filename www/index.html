        <strong>This is my website</strong> There are billions like it, but this

        My name is Slinky, and sometimes I'm Eeyore and I get snapped by Thanos.
        I run legacy hardware, with an expired warranty but I can be upgraded
        for future workloads as required. My daily driver is an iPad Pro, which
        I enjoy and I run Fedora natively on my 2020 13" Macbook Pro.

      <h2>Resume</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently looking for a <em>REMOTE</em> job, or a ~hybrid role. I'm
        open to re-location discussions if you can provide assistance, and you
        have a good canteen and mountain views. I'm based in Devon, United
        Kingdom. I maintain a professional home office environment; unlike my
        social media.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have <em>lots</em> of experience as a "Linux Systems Administrator". I
        don't know what I want to do next, so feel free to make a suggestion on
        my LinkedIn. Prior to my technical carrier I worked as a kitchen and
        shop assistant for a local pottery.

      <div class="resume">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Age 16, I was in ALPHA as the IT kid for an
            <a href="http://dktgroup.net/"
              >audio visual and home cinema installation business</a
            >
            in my village in Cornwall. I was banned from using Super Glue for
            life in this role.
          </li>
          <li>
            Age 18, I was BETA testing as Junior Linux SysAdmin for
            <a href="https://whois.domaintools.com/amplifeyesolutions.com"
              >Amplifeye Solutions</a
            >, a small Cornish web design and hosting business. I had a focus on
            general Linux administration and simple e-commerce websites using
            <a rel="tag" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OsCommerce"
              >OScommerce</a
            >. In this role I learn't how painful the `chmod` command can be if
            incorrectly used. An experienced Linux Systems Administrator reading
            this might recognise this situation, and can be reassured I have
            read `man` since then. Sorry,

            At this time I attended Cornwall College, studing for a

              >BTEC National Diploma in Information Technology</a
            >, with a focus on Structured Systems Analysis and Design
            Methodology. I also studied for and attained my Cisco Certified
            Network Associate qualifications via the onsite CISCO Academy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unleashed in to PRODUCTION in 2007, I developed <mark>Linux</mark> installation
            software at CERN using <mark>Perl</mark>, <mark>RPC/XML</mark> and <mark>Oracle</mark> after being invited
            as a Technical Student. The software I poorly developed is still in
            production in 2024 :/ Because the Internet never forgets, I can
            share some links I have found:

            regarding my software being used at the LHC. Some of my friends have
            made much bigger contributions that me though.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2009, I look out a £18,000 loan for a degree in
            <a
              href="https://info.uwe.ac.uk/programmes/specification.asp?file=g710-1040.pdf"

              >Depression</a
            >. After graduating, my first role was supporting <mark>Drupal 5 LAMP+</mark>
            stacks for charities and NGOs. I was able to use my experience in my
            last role as we started to operate a Cloud platform for the first
            time using <mark>Xen</mark> and <mark>VMWare</mark> ESXi/vSphere. I'm proud to have worked
            with people who want to help others and I enjoyed working on their
            technical challenges. This was the start of my learning about
            Docker, thanks to my exposure to <mark>OpenVZ</mark>. Thanks to this and other
            roles, I've been able to complete paying back my student loan.
          </li>
          <li>
            2012, I launched a <mark>Drupal 6</mark> website for
            <a href="https://www.eurostar.com/rw-en">Eurostar</a> which hit its
            revenue target on day 1. As a team we developed and launched a
            Drupal + <mark>ActiveMQ</mark> platform to support Eurostar's ecommerce
            operations. My focus was on DevOps engineering from project iniation
            through to production and involved technical and technical project
            management with third parties including Rackspace. I also provided
            offshore training to Capgemini India to ensure we were able to
            support the customer and their business, and other customers
            including Royal Mail and Burberry.
          </li>
          <li>
            Also in 2012, I volunteered at the
            <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-19201329">Olympics</a> and the
            Government said I could use a lot of walkie talkies in central
            London.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2013, I embraced Xen, <mark>Juniper</mark>, <mark>Nginx</mark> and string rack cabling
            displine for a <a href="https://futureplc.com/">Future PLC</a>. I
            started as an Operations Engineer in a small WebOps team, supporting
            a broad web and digital media estate. This included a multiple
            physical data center relocations, supporting CDN and Ad delivery
            platforms and providing mentorship to colleagues. Over time I
            progress in to a slight leadership role of a larger operations
            engineering team
          </li>
          
          <li>
            In 2015, I was a Linux SysAdmin for charities and NGOs, and
            discovered Kubernetes and Ubiquiti for
            <a href="https://torchbox.com/">Torchbox</a>. This role had a focus
            on <a href="https://wagtail.org/"><mark>Wagtail</mark></a> and
            Drupal platform support. This role taught me that organising a
            company office move is hardwork and requires strong planning and
            collaboration. Some
            <a href="https://crt.sh/?id=12445333">Internet archeaology</a> also
            shows me working with <mark>Riemann</mark>, <mark>Sensu</mark>,
            <mark>Consul</mark> and <mark>RabbitMQ</mark>.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2016, I
            <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/politics/eu_referendum/results"
              >cried</a
            >
            and went for a bike ride in France. I have a 2012 Cannondale Carbon
            Synapse, with f' SRAM :/
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2017, I joined <a href="https://adarga.ai/">Adarga</a> by
            offering my <mark>Kubernetes</mark> DevOps experience to start the foundations of
            a AI SaaS platform. I'm proud of my contributions iniating a long
            term relationship with Adarga.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2018, I did some
            <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43823532"
              >Cyber Security Incident training for Taskrabbit</a
            >, resulting in root. Everywhere. They did not ask for it, nor did
            they like it. They have decided they do not want to talk about it.
            They made it very easy, and initially I did just tell all about it,
            but as I said, they don't want to talk about it. I was a bit miffed
            about that, and gave them a slap in the face for their troubles. I
            have apologised, and will continue to do so.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2019, I contracted with Adarga focussing on <mark>CI/CD</mark> for the
            platform I originally developed in 2017. This was an enjoyable and
            unique opportunity to review the platform so far and to bring a
            fresh perspective to the Platform Team.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2020, I stayed indoors and did not talk about The Event. I also
            did some Machine Learning Infrastructure Engineering with Kubernetes
            for <a href="https://cookpad.com/us">Cookpad</a> in Bristol. I had a
            focus on Kubernetes deployment and observability using a range of
            <mark>Cloud Native</mark> products including
            <a href="https://kustomize.io/"><mark>Kustomize</mark></a>,
            <a href="https://fluxcd.io/"><mark>Flux</mark>></a>, <mark>Prometheus</mark> and <mark>Elastic</mark>. We
            also took time to explore a range of MLops possibilities including
            <mark>Kubeflow</mark>. I also decided to buy a new house.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2021, I moved into the Site Reliability Engineering team at
            Cookpad. A highlight of this role was learning-to-learn <mark>Go</mark>.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2022, I joined Adarga again, as a Lead Platform Engineer focussed
            on <mark>AWS cost reduction</mark>, Single Sign On (<mark>oAuth2/SAML</mark>), being the
            technical point of contact for customers and partners including the
            Ministry of Defence, AWS, Microsoft and Auth0 amongst others. Other
            aspects of my role here at the time included provided team
            leadership to the DevOps and DevSecOps teams, helping to plan and
            scope work, and offering guidance on technical activities including
            CI/CD using <mark>CircleCI</mark>, <mark>GitHub</mark> and <mark>Argo</mark>.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2024, I updated my website whilst attending an Alumni event at
            CERN, and registered for Universal Credit in the UK. I still need to
            <mark>fix the DNS</mark>. Perhaps I can show you on a video call how I will fix
            the DNS? In the mean time I can show you what this website looked

        <h2>My Music Collection</h2>
        <p>
          My
          <a href="https://rtfm.danslinky.co.uk/choons">music collection</a> is
          known to drift through my microphone in to a colleagues ears at the
          start of a standup or an incident @huddle. Here's a little
          introduction to my music collection. I do take requests!
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          And now, the end is near. And so I face, the final curtain. My friend,
          I'll say it clear. I'll state my case, of which I'm certain. I've
          lived, a life that's full. I travelled each and every highway. And
          more, much more than this. He did it his way. Regrets, I've had a few.
          But then again, too few to mention. I did, what I had to do. And saw
          it through, without exemption. I planned, each chartered course. Each
          careful step, along the by-way And more, much more than this. He did
          it his way. Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew. When I bit off,
          more than I could chew. But through it all, when there was doubt. I
          ate it up, and spit it out I faced it all, and I stood tall. And he
          did it his way I've loved, I've laughed, and cried. I've had my fill,
          my share of losing. And now, as tears subside. He finds it all, so
          amusing. To think, I did all that. And may I say, not in a shy way. Oh
          no, oh no, not me He did it his way. For what is a man, what has he
          got? If not himself, then he has null. To say the things he truly
          feels. And not the words of one who kneels. The record shows, I took
          the blows.
          <br />
          And did it my way.
          <br />
          Yes, it was MY way.

        Here are some businesses I do not hesitate to recommend, and one I do
        not recommend.
      </p>

      alongside the beautiful Dordogne.

      <h2>Redrow</h2>
      <p>
        I,
        <em
          ><b><u>DO NOT RECOMMEND</u></b></em
        >
        buying a house from Redrow. It has not been a pleasant experience, and
        my new front door is still wonky. I am more than a little miffed, and so
        are my neighbours, because we have told them this more than a few times.
