            In 2013, I embraced <mark>Xen</mark>, <mark>Juniper</mark>, <mark>Nginx</mark>, and
            string rack cabling discipline for <mark id="future">Future</mark>. I
            started as an <mark>Operations Engineer</mark> in a small WebOps team, supporting a

            center relocations to support consolidation, supporting a <mark>Global CDN</mark> and Ad
            delivery platforms and providing mentorship to colleagues. Over time I
            progress into a slight leadership role of a larger operations
            engineering team.

            nor did they like it. They have decided they do not want to talk about
            it. They made it very easy, and initially I did just tell them all about it,
            but as I said, they don't want to talk about it. I was a bit miffed
            about that, and gave them a slap in the face for their troubles. I have
            apologised, and will continue to do so.&nbsp;<cite>NCSC Cyber Incident REF 040224-1.</cite>

                  My
                  <a href="https://rtfm.danslinky.co.uk/choons">music collection</a>
                  is known to drift through my microphone in to a colleagues ears at
                  the start of a standup or an incident @huddle. Here's a little
                  introduction to my music collection. I do take requests!
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                  And now, the end is near. And so I face, the final curtain. My
                  friend, I'll say it clear. I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.
                  I've lived, a life that's full. I travelled each and every highway.
                  And more, much more than this. He did it his way. Regrets, I've had
                  a few. But then again, too few to mention. I did, what I had to do.
                  And saw it through, without exemption. I planned, each chartered
                  course. Each careful step, along the by-way And more, much more than
                  this. He did it his way. Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew.
                  When I bit off, more than I could chew. But through it all, when
                  there was doubt. I ate it up, and spit it out I faced it all, and I
                  stood tall. And he did it his way I've loved, I've laughed, and
                  cried. I've had my fill, my share of losing. And now, as tears
                  subside. He finds it all, so amusing. To think, I did all that. And
                  may I say, not in a shy way. Oh no, oh no, not me He did it his way.
                  For what is a man, what has he got? If not himself, then he has
                  null. To say the things he truly feels. And not the words of one who
                  kneels. The record shows, I took the blows.
                  <br />
                  And did it my way.
                  <br />
                  Yes, it was MY way.

            buying a house from Redrow. It has not been a pleasant experience, and
            my new front door is still wonky. I am more than a little miffed, and so
            are my neighbours, because we have told them this more than a few times.
