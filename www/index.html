         <h2>About</h2>
         <p>Welcome to my corner of the World Wide Web! Among the vast digital landscape, this website stands as my
            personal mySpace -
            a blend of professionalism and personality.
            Inspired by Mary Poppins' philosophy, I believe in infusing every task with a touch of enjoyment, turning
            work into a
            delightful adventure.</p>

         <p>I'm known as Slinky, a mix of Eeyore's realism and a dash of Thanos' snap.
            While my hardware may be considered legacy, it's ripe for upgrades to meet
            evolving demands. Whether navigating the digital realm on my trusty iPad Pro
            or exploring the possibilities of Fedora on my MacBook Pro, I embrace technology with gusto.</p>

         <p>One of my cherished reads is jPod, reflecting my eclectic taste. Join me on my
            journey via GitHub, where I document my job hunt under @danslinky's Job Hunt. Feel
            free to engage, comment, or spark discussions - it's all about the collective journey forward.</p>

      <h2>Resume</h2>

      <p>
         I'm actively seeking a remote or hybrid role, with the possibility of relocation if the opportunity
         offers breathtaking mountain views and a stellar canteen. Currently rooted in Devon, United Kingdom,
         my home office exudes professionalism, contrasting with the casual flair of my social media presence.
      </p>
      <p>
         My background is rich in Platform Engineering, honed through years of hands-on experience.
         As I embark on the next chapter of my career, I welcome suggestions and connections on <a
            href="https://linkedin.com/in/danslinky">LinkedIn</a>.
         Prior to diving into the technical realm, I immersed myself in the world of pottery, serving
         as a kitchen and shop assistant - a testament to my diverse skill set and adaptability.

         <p>
            At age 16, I was in <mark id="release">ALPHA</mark> as the IT kid for

            <a href="http://dktgroup.net/">audio-visual and home cinema installation business</a>
            in my village in Cornwall. I was banned from using Super Glue for life
            in this role.

         <h3>2002</h3>
         <p>
            Age 18, I was <mark id="release">BETA</mark> testing as a Junior Linux
            SysAdmin for
            <a href="https://whois.domaintools.com/amplifeyesolutions.com">Amplifeye Solutions</a>, a small Cornish web
            design and hosting business. I had a focus on
            general Linux administration and simple e-commerce websites using
            <a rel="tag" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OsCommerce">OSCommerce</a>. In this role, I learned how
            painful the `chmod` command can be if
            incorrectly used. An experienced Linux Systems Administrator reading
            this might recognize this situation and can be reassured I have read
            `man` since then. Sorry,

         <p>
            Unleashed into <mark id="release">PRODUCTION</mark> in 2007 with a
            <mark>LaTeX</mark> resume, I developed <mark>Linux</mark> installation

            production in 2024 :/ Because the Internet never forgets, I can share
            some links I have found:
            <a href="https://linux.web.cern.ch/installation/aims/">RTFM</a>,

            presentation to the IT department. My non-technical contributions
            included hosting data center tours during open days and
            <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/1120956">lobbying the British Government</a>. One day I hope to be able
            to publish a statement of affairs
            regarding my software being used at the LHC. Some of my friends have
            made much bigger contributions than me though.

            In 2009, I took out an ¬£18,000 loan for a degree in

            role was supporting
            <mark>Drupal 5 LAMP+</mark> stacks for charities and NGO. I was able
            to use my experience in my last role as we started to operate a Cloud
            platform for the first time using <mark>Xen</mark> and
            <mark>VMWare</mark> <mark>ESXi/vSphere</mark>. I'm proud to have
            worked with people who want to help others and I enjoyed working on
            their technical challenges. This was the start of my learning about
            <mark>Docker</mark>, thanks to my exposure to <mark>OpenVZ</mark>.
            Thanks to this and other roles, I've been able to complete paying back

         In 2013, I embraced <mark>Xen</mark>, <mark>Juniper</mark>, <mark>Nginx</mark>, and
         string rack cabling discipline for <mark id="future">Future</mark>. I
         started as an <mark>Operations Engineer</mark> in a small WebOps team, supporting a
         broad web and digital media estate. This included multiple physical data
         center relocations to support consolidation, supporting a <mark>Global CDN</mark> and Ad
         delivery platforms and providing mentorship to colleagues. Over time I
         progress into a slight leadership role of a larger operations

         In 2015, I was a Linux SysAdmin for charities and NGOs, and discovered
         <mark>Kubernetes</mark> and <mark>Ubiquiti</mark> for
         <mark id="torchbox">Torchbox</mark>. This role had a focus on
         <a href="https://wagtail.org/"><mark>Wagtail</mark></a> and <mark>Drupal 7</mark>
         platform support. This role taught me that organising a company office
         move is hard work and requires strong planning and collaboration. Some

         resulting in <code>root</code>. Everywhere. They did not ask for it,
         nor did they like it. They have decided they do not want to talk about
         it. They made it very easy, and initially I did just tell them all about it,
         but as I said, they don't want to talk about it. I was a bit miffed
         about that, and gave them a slap in the face for their troubles. I have
         apologised, and will continue to do so.&nbsp;<cite>NCSC Cyber Incident REF 040224-1.</cite>

            </p>
            <blockquote>
               And now, the end is near. And so I face, the final curtain. My
               friend, I'll say it clear. I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.
               I've lived, a life that's full. I travelled each and every highway.
               And more, much more than this. He did it his way. Regrets, I've had
               a few. But then again, too few to mention. I did, what I had to do.
               And saw it through, without exemption. I planned, each chartered
               course. Each careful step, along the by-way And more, much more than
               this. He did it his way. Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew.
               When I bit off, more than I could chew. But through it all, when
               there was doubt. I ate it up, and spit it out I faced it all, and I
               stood tall. And he did it his way I've loved, I've laughed, and
               cried. I've had my fill, my share of losing. And now, as tears
               subside. He finds it all, so amusing. To think, I did all that. And
               may I say, not in a shy way. Oh no, oh no, not me He did it his way.
               For what is a man, what has he got? If not himself, then he has
               null. To say the things he truly feels. And not the words of one who
               kneels. The record shows, I took the blows.
               <br />
               And did it my way.

      <p>
         I,
         <em><b><u>DO NOT RECOMMEND</u></b></em>
         buying a house from Redrow. It has not been a pleasant experience, and
         my new front door is still wonky. I am more than a little miffed, and so
         are my neighbours, because we have told them this more than a few times.
