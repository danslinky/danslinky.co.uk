# :simple-latex: LaTeX

This is work in progress.

Run `make` in this directory to convert the markdown to [resume.tex](resume.tex), ussing some [Lua](fontawesome.lua) to fix some of the fontawesome icons, and generate a __[resume.pdf](resume.pdf)__ using `pandoc`.

## notes

- fix errors with `[link](javascript:xxx)`
- `fontawesome.lua` could be improved with more icon support
- superfences markdown tabbed content doesn't render yet
