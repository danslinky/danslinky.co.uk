I'm applying for the Technical Engineer role, with Platforms and Workflows and want to make sure I really showcase my technical skillset.

I am an experienced engineer, with a range of skill and experience across SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and co-location.

I've enjoyed the Container, Orchestration and Cloud Native epoch moments and continue to embrace open source, contributing back where I can.

For this position, we are looking for someone with demonstrated experience in the following areas:

I have senior technical DevSecOps competencies and experience operating and optimizing mission-critical production container and virtual multi-vendor Cloud services, supporting users and developers to design, deploy, and orchestrate using GitOps and CI/CD workflows, whilst supporting multiple stakeholders and requirements.

I have working knowledge of Golang, Python and other languages. I haven't written any Perl since I last worked at CERN, but I did recently learn some Lua, and I'm resisting having a go with Rust. Linus said it was cool, and I like emojis.

I have a strong technical grasp of a range of CNCF projects including [Kustomize, Flux, Argo], IaC tools including Terragrunt, Terraform and Ansible, and I'm deeply familiar with Cloud Native *aaS platforms including GitHub and GitLab.

I've administer and maintained public and private systems, tracked release notes, rolled out patches, rolled out the follow up patch and performed Cloud and Email migrations, and restored at least one production Drupal database in my career.

I provide myself on giving the best support possible.

I'm able to quickly identity, assess, mitigate and resolve problems when they occur, pragmatically and timely. I'm proud of my incident response capabilities, and equally proud of my LinkedIn testimonials reflecting this.

I deliver solutions that work, provide value and fulll and when possibe exceed expectations. I enjoy a collaborative and partipatory enivronment, working on a shared objective and sharing our passions for the tools we use, and experiences we have.

I can speak English, in ascii and emoji, use an  Elgato Wave microphone and I can't wait to get enough permission to edit the metadata my CERN IT Department presentation twiki upload.

I enjoy writing documentation, especially when it's in markdown.

I like to learn and share, whether that's grabbing coffee with a colleague, spilling coffee over their keyboard or sharing the driving with them on the way to FOSDEM. For this contract, I'm going to set myself the goal of giving a FOSDEM lightning talk, in French.

_Do you think it will be about markdown?_
