# DNS

Remember, it's probably always DNS.

|Domains I own|Purpose|
|danslinky.co.uk|Pimp myself out|
|ardarga.dev|Annoy adarga.ai|

DNS is maintained at the registra, or Cloudflare.

The apex for danslinky.co.uk is broken. Please give me a job.

ardarga.dev uses GoDaddy's SME features to pretend to be a company using Microsoft. The MX, SPF et al. records need some work done to them.
