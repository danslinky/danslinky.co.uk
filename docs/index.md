# Dan Slinky

Welcome to my corner of the <mark>World Wide Web</mark>. Among the vast digital landscape, this website stands as my personal mySpace - a blend of professionalism and personality. Inspired by Mary Poppins' philosophy, I believe in infusing every task with a touch of enjoyment, turning work into a delightful adventure.

I'm known as <mark><large>Slinky</large></mark>, a mix of <mark style=color:white;background-color:black><small>Eeyore</small></mark>  and a dash of <mark style=color:purple;background-color:transparent>T̨͈͗̌ͥḣ̖̻͛̓ā̤̓̍͘ṇ̤͛̒̍o̯̱̊͊͢s̠҉͍͊ͅ''</mark> snap. While my hardware may be considered legacy, it's ripe for upgrades to meet evolving demands. Whether navigating the digital realm on my trusty iPad Pro or exploring the possibilities of [Asahi Fedora](https://asahilinux.org/) on my MacBook Pro, I embrace technology with gusto.

One of my cherished reads is [jPod](jpod.md), reflecting my eclectic taste. Join me on my journey via [GitHub](github.md){ data-preview }, where I document my job hunt under [@danslinky](https://github.com/danslinky)'s Job Hunt. Feel free to engage, comment, or spark discussions - it's all about the collective journey forward.
