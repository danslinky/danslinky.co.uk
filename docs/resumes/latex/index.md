# :simple-latex: LaTeX

This is work in progress, and generates __[resume.pdf](resume.pdf)__

I `make` use of the `fontawesome5` package, and a [Lua](fontawesome.lua) `pandoc` filter to workaround not having worked out how to support v6 of fontawesome yet.

## notes

- fix errors with `[link](javascript:xxx)`
- `fontawesome.lua` could be improved with more icon support
- superfences markdown tabbed content doesn't render well, and interprets it as a codeblock without wrap
