# Resume as a Service (RaaS)

!!! note "#opentowork"

    I'm actively seeking a new <large><b>remote</b></large> or <small>hybrid</small> role, with the possibility of relocation if the opportunity offers breathtaking mountain views and a stellar canteen. I'm currently rooted in the ~~EU~~:flag_gb::fire:, where my [home office](https://github.com/danslinky/danslinky.co.uk/issues/2) exudes professionalism, contrasting with the casual flair of my [social media](/about) presence.

Welcome to my RaaS! <small>~~RAaS~~ ~~rAAS~~ ~~rAPI~~</small> :eyes:

<blockquote>
Dan is one of the best platform engineers I've worked with. He has a vast knowledge of AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform and similar platform technologies. I learned a lot while working together. He is capable of taking a vague requirement and converting it into working infrastructure. He puts thought into the maintainability, scalability and observability of his solutions and writes good accompanying documentation. Dan is also a good mentor helping other in the team and even outside of his team upskill and learn from him.
