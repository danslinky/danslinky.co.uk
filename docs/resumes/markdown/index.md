## Introduction

=== "Personal Statement"

    With over 15 years of experience in Platform, Site Reliability, and DevSecOps Engineering, I have been fortunate enough to experience the evolution of Kubernetes and the Cloud Native landscape and have developed an expertise in Identity and SSO implementations, Infrastructure as Code using Terragrunt, Terraform, Ansible, and Puppet, and automated security and dependency pipelines. I'm skilled in GitOps workflows hosted on AWS, Google, GitHub Actions, :fontawesome-brands-gitlab: GitLab, CircleCI, and others, leveraging CD/CD ArgoCD, FluxCD, helm, kustomize and jsonnet.

    Additionally, I have proficiency in container technologies including containerd and Docker, along with (some) proficiency in Perl, Python, and Golang. I prioritise maintainability, scalability, and observability, ensuring that my solutions are not only functional but also well-documented. Additionally, I like to fostering a culture of continuous learning, skill development and knowledge sharing.

    In my previous roles I have contributed to the design, development, and maintenance of the global platforms that serves lots of angry users. I leveraged my skills in Kubernetes, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and other on-premise and Cloud Native technologies to ensure high availability, performance, and security of the platform, as well as to enable the deployment and integration of machine learning models and services. I also collaborated with other engineers, product managers, and stakeholders to identify and resolve technical issues, improve processes, and deliver value to the users and the organisation.
