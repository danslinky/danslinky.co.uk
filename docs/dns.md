# DNS

Remember, it's probably always DNS.

DNS is maintained at the registra, or Cloudflare.

The apex for `danslinky.co.uk` is broken. Please give me a job and I will fix it.

`ardarga.dev` uses GoDaddy's SME features to pretend to be a company using Microsoft, along with all the other PaaS/SaaS/FaaS...

The MX, SPF et al. records need some work done to them.
