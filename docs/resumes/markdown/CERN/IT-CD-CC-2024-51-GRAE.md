## Description

Join the team operating and evolving the 5'000+ node HTCondor based High-Throughput batch service at the heart of the CERN data processing!

Are you a talented Computing Engineer who would like to come and work with computing at scale, helping run the compute farm at the heart of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid? As a member of the team responsible for the batch service, you will have a varied role, from helping to automate the delivery of compute, to self healing infrastructure, to helping physicists and researchers use the facility efficiently.

The Compute and Devices (CD) group in CERN IT provides a wide range of compute services, all the way from end user devices, through cloud infrastructure-as-a- Service, configuration management, batch and HPC computing at CERN, together with a set of services that support the whole WLCG.

As a member of the Compute and Configuration (CC) section of the CD group, you will join a team of engineers in charge of these services. We run the compute facility that comprises approximately 20% of the WLCG, using tools such as Puppet, OpenStack and Kubernetes to manage batch systems running HTCondor, HPC systems running SLURM, and the support services keeping everything glued together.

Your main functions will include:

- Running and helping to evolve the HTCondor based batch system.
- Integrating and deploying automation to manage server lifecycle, and to react to monitoring data to self-heal.
- Evaluate new technologies, for automation, core components and related services.
- Provide support to the wide user community.

## Profile

__Skills and/or knowledge__

- Strong knowledge of Linux, git, programming languages such as Python or Go -
- Desirable: Puppet, Kubernetes
- Any knowledge of batch systems such as HTCondor, SLURM or Nomad would be a plus, as would knowledge of Infrastructure as Code tools such as Terraform.
- Fluent in English, the ability to work in French would be an advantage.
