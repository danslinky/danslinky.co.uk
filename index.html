<h2>Super Bon Bon</h2>

Move aside, And let the man go through. Let the man go through.
Move aside, And let the man go through. Let the man go through
Move aside, And let the man go through. Let the man go through 
Move aside, And let the man go through. Let the man go through through.

If I stole. Somebody else's wave, To fly up. If I rose up. With the avenue behind me.

Some kind of verb. Some kind of moving thing. Something unseen. Some hand is motioning. To rise, to rise, to rise

Too fat, fat you must cut lean. You got to take the elevator to the mezzanine. Chump, change, and it's on, super bon bon. Super bon bon, Super bon bon. Too fat, fat you must cut lean. You got to take the elevator to the mezzanine. Chump, change, and it's on, super bon bon. Super bon bon, Super bon bon

And by. The phone. I live. In fear. Sheer Chance. Will draw. You in. To here

“Super bon bon, super bon bon 
Super bon bon, super bon bon 
Super bon bon, super bon bon 
Super bon bon bon bon”

<h2>h2. My Way</h2>

And now, the end is near.
And so I face, the final curtain.
My friend, I'll say it clear. 
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.

I've lived, a life that's full.
I travelled each and every highway. 
And more, much more than this.
He did it his way.

Regrets, I've had a few.
But then again, too few to mention.
I did, what I had to do.
And saw it through, without exemption.

I planned, each chartered course.
Each careful step, along the by-way 
And more, much more than this.
He did it his way.

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew. 
When I bit off, more than I could chew.
But through it all, when there was doubt. 
I ate it up, and spit it out 
I faced it all, and I stood tall.
And he did it his way

I've loved, I've laughed, and cried. 
I've had my fill, my share of losing. 
And now, as tears subside.
He finds it all, so amusing.

To think, I did all that.
And may I say, not in a shy way. 
Oh no, oh no, not me 
He did it his way.

For what is a man, what has he got? 
If not himself, then he has null.
To say the things he truly feels. 
And not the words of one who kneels. 
The record shows, I took the blows.
</p>

<p>And did it my way.<br />
Yes, it was my way.</p>

<h2>A Spoonful Of Sugar</h2>

In every job that must be done, There is an element of fun.
You find the fun and... snap! 

The job's a game.
And every task you undertake, Becomes a piece of cake.
A lark! A spree! It's very clear to see 

That... a... 

Spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down 
The medicine go do--own 
The medicine go down 

Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.
In a most delightful way.

<i>[whistle]</i>

A robin feathering his nest, Has very little time to rest, While gathering his bits of twine and twig.
Though quite intent in his pursuit, he has a merry tune to toot, He knows a song will move the job along.

For a Spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.
The medicine go do--own.
The medicine go down.
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.
In a most delightful way. 
<b>Cheeky!</b>
