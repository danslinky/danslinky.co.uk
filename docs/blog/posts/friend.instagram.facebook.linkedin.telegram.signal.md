# hello, friend

How do you talk to your friends?

<!-- more -->

I'm a Millennial. I don't call my friends.

I have one friend on SMS, but we've migrated to Signal recently.

Signal's one of the better ways I talk to my friends. I mostly trust the links my friends send me on Signal.

I tried to automate my Signal integration recently, installing https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli 

I installed and wrangled it to add my laptop as a device and etched out a script to take a screenshot of me at my desk, grab a screenshot, time watermark it and post it to Signal's Note to Self. It all worked really nicely.
