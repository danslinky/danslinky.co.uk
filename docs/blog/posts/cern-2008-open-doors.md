# CERN Journee Portes Ouvertes 2008

<!-- more -->

I was a volontaire pour la Journee Portes Ouvertes 2008, giving guided tours of the CERN Computing Centre (Building 513) in English. It was awesome repeating how high a stack of CDs would be if the LHC stored all its scientific data on them. Fortuantly it didn't, and I got to tell people about hot and cold air aisles, tape robots crushing people to death and how a Linux server gets installed.
