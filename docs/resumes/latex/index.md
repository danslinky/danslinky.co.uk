# LaTeX

This is work in progress. Run `make` in this directory to convert the markdown to [resume.tex](resume.tex), and use [Lua](fontawesome.lua) to fix some of the fontawesome icons, and view the resulting [resume.pdf](resume.pdf)

## notes

__@TODO__: fix errors with `[link](javascript:xxx)`
__@TODO__: `fontawesome.lua` could be improved with more icon support
