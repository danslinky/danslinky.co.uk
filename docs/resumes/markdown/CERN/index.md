### Groups and Sections

#### IT-CD

__Compute & Devices__

The IT-CD group operates, maintains and supports the scientific computing services needed by the laboratory and its experiments, including the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid. The group runs end-users desktop and mobile services and supports the Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems as well as operating systems of mobile phones (iOS and Android). The group also licenses, deploys and configure core productivity applications for Windows and macOS including Microsoft Office across CERN. Finally the group provides interactive terminal services for both window and Linux users together with batch farms for physics analysis.

##### CC

__Control & Configuration__

Provide a first-class set of scientific computing services to deliver the diverse development and large-scale compute requirements of the Organisation and the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid. Provide efficient service configuration and operational support tools to ensure the Organisationâ€™s IT services can meet the coming challenges at the LHC scale.

#### IT-DA

__Databases & Analytics__

The Database and Analytics Group is responsible for service delivery and evolution of databases, data stores, monitoring, messaging, streaming, analytics and data visualisation solutions for the different CERN communities.

##### ASM

__Analytics, Streaming and Monitoring__

The section provides Messaging, data Streaming, Monitoring platforms and services, and frontend analytics services for the different CERN communities to facilitate data collection, transport, manipulation, processing, interactive data analysis and central reporting solutions.

The section also provides support to the group services and activities in the External Clouds Service (Oracle Cloud).

##### IT-PW

__Platforms & Workflows__

The IT Platforms and Workflows group provides tools and services for all CERN and HEP user communities:

- Platforms for reproducible analysis workflows
- Identity and access management, including computing resource lifecycles
platforms for developers: version control, container management and machine learning tools, including access through notebooks
- Web services hosting solutions
- Authoring tools
- Platform for managed application deployments (engineering and administrative applications)

###### WA

__Web and Authoring__

The Web and Authoring section provides tools and platforms for authoring, collaborating and publishing information on the Web.

These include the central Web hosting services, Online Collaboration tools (Overleaf, SharePoint, TWiki, CodiMD), Web content management systems (Drupal), Publishing services (E-publishing - OJS), static documentation sites, Search as a Service to support information access for large applications (Indico, EDMS) and the global CERN Search engine, as well as Source Code management (Gitlab).

###### PI

__Platform Infrastructure__

Platforms Infrastructure provides:

- container orchestration platform (Kubernetes)
- platforms for deployment, hosting and operation of applications and third-party tools (OpenShift)
- platform for machine learning workflows (Kubeflow)
- platform for issue tracking (Jira)
- Web Services Portal

## LHCb

LHCb, the Large Hadron Collider beauty experiment, searches for new forces and particles by measuring with unprecedented precision the decays of particles containing beauty quarks, charm quarks and their antimatter equivalents.
