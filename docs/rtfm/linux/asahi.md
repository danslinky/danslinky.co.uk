#  :simple-asahilinux: Asahi :simple-fedora: Linux (and :simple-archlinux:)

I :heart: Asahi Linux; probably the best Linux installation I have ever performed.

I run Asahi Linux on my 2020 13" Macbook Pro after I literally `curl | sh` it one day after getting fed up with the bloat of :simple-macos:.

Initially Asahi Linux used Arch, which was a familiar and pleasant experience but pretty much nothing worked. No speakers, camera, USB, touchbar (I have a physical ESC key, because 2020 13") and I enjoyed semi daily driving it.

Then one day the folks at Fedora dropped their initial remix and once again I was booting up :simple-macos: to `curl linux | sh` on to my ~~new~~ Apple device.

Running Fedora Wayland KDE Plasma on it is a wonderful Linux Laptop experience, but for ~~personal~~ memory reasons I've stripped that all away and going back to running [AwesomeWM](awesome.md). I might have insulted Emacs elsewhere on my website, but you can rest assured my fingers are being contorted.

Pros:
- Linux builds don't sound like a jet airplane taking off
- KVM (qemu) on `arm64` :chef-kiss: (mostly)
- Reclaimed my hard disk space, after I purged some :simple-macos:

Cons:
- HDMI, fingerprint reader no worky
- USB detection/hotplug needs some work
- I'm running awesomewm, which is awesome, but I have no idea what I'm doing with it most of the time
- I did not know dnf was a thing now, and was initially very confused.
- Only finding a linux_arm64
