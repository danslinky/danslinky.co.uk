## Personal Statement

With over 15 years of experience in Platform, Site Reliability, and DevSecOps Engineering, I have been fortunate enough to experience the evolution of Kubernetes and the Cloud Native landscape and have developed an expertise in Identity and SSO implementations, Infrastructure as Code using Terragrunt, Terraform, Ansible, and Puppet, and automated security and dependency pipelines. I'm skilled in GitOps workflows hosted on AWS, Google, GitHub Actions, GitLab, CircleCI, and others, leveraging CD/CD ArgoCD, FluxCD, helm, kustomize and jsonnet.

Additionally, I have proficiency in container technologies including containerd and Docker, along with (some) proficiency in Perl, Python, and Golang. I prioritise maintainability, scalability, and observability, ensuring that my solutions are not only functional but also well-documented. Additionally, I like to fostering a culture of continuous learning, skill development and knowledge sharing.

In my previous roles I have contributed to the design, development, and maintenance of the global platforms that serves lots of angry users. I leveraged my skills in Kubernetes, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and other on-premise and Cloud Native technologies to ensure high availability, performance, and security of the platform, as well as to enable the deployment and integration of machine learning models and services. I also collaborated with other engineers, product managers, and stakeholders to identify and resolve technical issues, improve processes, and deliver value to the users and the business.

## Career and Experience

### Lead Platform Engineer, Adarga
Technical leadership in the Platform Engineering and SecOps team, operating a multi-tenanted AI SaaS platform on AWS.

- Utilised Terragrunt, Terraform, AWS and other platforms ensuring robust security and secrets management to meet stringent customer requirements. Leveraging credential storage, scanning and code-quality practices, and using CI/CD pipelines through GitHub Actions, CircleCI, and ArgoCD, I helped deliver efficient and reliable deployments.

- Lead a significant AWS cost reduction initiative and championed FinOps practices. I worked on optimising reporting on cloud spending using tools like opencost.io, kubecost, Prometheus, and SysDig to help foster more ownership and accountability of individual services, and to identify areas for further optimisation.

- I collaborated on the implementation of OpenTracing/Telemetry, bolstering application observability and performance in environments using Kafka and Benthos for message routing.

- I am responsible for expanding the SSO offering by implementing SAML Microsoft AD integration, supported by Auth0 enable the customer to have a seamless user experience.

- I undertook a technical feasibility of Plausible web analytics for usage in the platform, and mentored team members working on the implementation of Tigergraph and Neo4j as part of some feature development.

- I also had responsibility for recruitment in to the team, conducting Interviews, promoting team planning before handling over to a permanent Engineering Manager and recruitement team.


### Cookpad

I began my journey with the MLOps team on a short term contract, initially focusing on Kubernetes observability, and then joined on a permanent basis focussing on Kubernetes ML application deployment.

I deployed Elastic and Prometheus/Thanos for longer duration metric storage, alongside Grafana/Loki to help foster ownership of ML applications as they were deployed.

I revitalized the Kubernetes application distribution and deployment by making use of Kustomize and Flux CD, while evaluating Kubeflow/Argo Pipelines for potential future investment.

I later moved in to the SRE team, taking on a more Global platform responsibility working closely with colleagues at Cookpad Japan. I embraced learning Golang and discovered the power of Jsonnet in this new role.

I collaborated with colleagues in the SRE team to improve documentation, respond to on call incidents, migrate Kafka from the Managed Cloud to team managed Kubernetes, and respond to ad hoc support requests.

## DevOps Engineer, Adarga

Inaugural DevOps at Adarga, I played a role in establishing the foundation of an AI SaaS platform, leveraging Kubernetes and collaborating closely with the wider engineering and data science teams.  

- My responsibilities spanned AWS and Google Cloud environments, where I implemented Ansible and YAML for deploying self-hosted and Google Kubernetes clusters and applications.

- Adopting a microservice's architecture, I integrated technologies such as Kafka, Python, Java, Node.js, single-page applications (SPAs), and OAuth2 via Auth0, while also implementing the platform API gateway using Kong/nginx, and explored service mesh options such istio and Weave.

- Additionally, I managed onboarding processes using Apple MDM, fleet DM, osquery, munki, and handled app packaging and deployment, I deployed and maintained the Atlassian stack, including Jira, Confluence, and Bamboo, on AWS.
